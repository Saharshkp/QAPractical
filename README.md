QA Practical Project

This project outcome is to create an application that generates objects. These objects are to be upon a set of predefined rules.

I am required to create a service-orientated architecture for my application which must be composed of at least 4 services that work together.

My idea for this this project is to have a pokemon trainer application.
My application will randomly give you a very cool pokemon. Then it will provide you with its rarity class and its level so you can determine its strength. All these object have been defined eventhough the selection is random.
